TO maximize your learning, only look at my 
solution to each part after you have gotten 
yours working.  

Then, if you want to either use the solution to one part as the starting 
point for your next part, or incorporate some of its ideas into your 
solution before beginning the next part, feel free to do so.

Before you use the solution, you should understand it all.
Ask questions if anything in the solution is unclear to you.

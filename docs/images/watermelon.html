There is no precision in winning a watermelon-eating contest.  <p>
  <p>
Contestants -- reckless youth, enchanted adults -- all with eyes toward the crowd, assume the stance: bent knees, out-thrusted elbows and a firm, if soggy, grip on the rind-cradled melon.  <p>
  <p>
"You're seeing the finest watermelon eaters in the entire county -- possibly the entire state," says 4-H leader and event organizer Mary Ann Sedletzeck, lending gravity to the championship round Monday evening.  <p>
  <p>
And with a "3-2-1 -- Eat!" from the crowd, the front lawn of the 4-H building at the Wabash Valley Fairgrounds is pummeled with fat pink chunks of melon and a downpour of liquid from mouths runneth over.  <p>
  <p>
In a matter of seconds, round after round, a hand clutching a rind is thrust into the air by a drippy elbow. It is fruit-spewing victory, sticky and sweet.  <p>
  <p>
"This is what they're going to remember when they grow up," says Sedletzeck, a kindergarten teacher raised in a 4-H family.  <p>
  <p>
For some champions, devouring watermelon seems second-nature.  <p>
  <p>
"I didn't have no practice," says 7-year-old Layne Curley, her chin stained pink beneath brown-freckled cheeks. Curley, whose 4-H projects include gardening, flowers and foods, took the top prize in the "Girls, 10 and under" round.  <p>
  <p>
The younger boys champion, Wyatt Sowards, 10, -- who is showing a horse and a dog at the fair -- gives a more in-depth, post-round wrap-up.  <p>
  <p>
"I did my teeth-scraper," he says. "It works with cantaloupe."  <p>
  <p>
Layne's sister, Hanna, "11-and-a-half" and a champion in the older girls category, offers the perspective of age.  <p>
  <p>
"I just went side to side and took big bites," she says.  <p>
  <p>
Big bites are necessary as the competition heats up in the older boys round. In a last-second change, two contestants' pieces of watermelon are swapped out because the wedges are "wimpy."  <p>
  <p>
"Now, we're really going to have to watch, because it's really competitive," says Sedletzeck, instructing the judges.  <p>
  <p>
In a fraction of the earlier rounds' duration, <b>Will Anderson</b>, 12, hoists his gutted rind in the air and is able to speak, "watermelon," one of the rules of the contest.  <p>
  <p>
"Wow, that is a world record," Sedletzeck supposes.  <p>
  <p>
Anderson has tasted such victory before, when he was the 2001 champion. His secret?  <p>
  <p>
"I smash it -- rub it against my teeth," he says, a morsel of watermelon having just fallen from his cheek.  <p>
  <p>
Will's mom, <b>Diane Anderson</b>, defends the family title as the women's champion.  <p>
  <p>
"I'm crazy," she says.  <p>
  <p>
But the Sowards forge a legacy, as well, as Wyatt's dad, Dale, takes the men's title. His wife says he doesn't even like watermelon.  <p>
  <p>
But the champion to beat all is Becky Lynn, 15, of Riley, who takes the championship round before running to a trash barrel to spit out a mouthful of fruit. She is a humble champion.  <p>
  <p>
"It's just for the fun," says Lynn  <p>
  <p>
, who will show chickens, rabbits and sheep at 4-H shows.  <p>
  <p>
What follows the hasty burrowing into a watermelon rind is a more exact exercise -- spitting the seeds.  <p>
  <p>
Eating contestants line up before a white plastic sheet that bears markings of progressive encouragement -- "He-man," "Way to Go!," "Record-Setter," and so on.  <p>
  <p>
With a couple of seeds from the previous competition stuck to their palms, each spitter gets two shots. Qualifying seeds must hit the plastic, so wind resistance is to be heeded.  <p>
  <p>
Charlene McKean, an organizer along with Sedletzeck, chooses the rolled-tongue spit with little success.  <p>
  <p>
Bethany Wenzel, 14, shoots an estimated 28-footer to take second place. But the spitting champion is a Lafayette 12-year-old who is helping his cousin show rabbits at the fair. With a 30-foot threat to the Indiana State Fair record, Dustin Wallace's seed hit near the end of the mat, meeting awe from onlookers.  <p>
  <p>
His winning tactic, he says is something unseen in the entire evening's competition: "Spit dry."  <p>

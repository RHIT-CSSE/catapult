Spend a few minutes playing with Python graphics.
(begin your code with <b>from graphics import *</b>)<p>You could keep enhancing your drawing forever, but
we will stop at some point and continue our discussions. <br>
But before we do that, I'll have everyone look at everyone else's drawing.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Your task is to draw a creative rendition of a house that you design.</li>
	<li>Look up the documentation for the Python graphics library (<a href=graphics.pdf>graphics.pdf</a>); you can also find it 
	in the <code>Python Docs and Examples</code> folder on your desktop). 
		What other cool shapes could you add to your house?
	</li>
	<li>Begin experimenting with some of these methods.
		Add a line or two of code and then execute your program.
		Once you get the hang of this, start drawing your house.
	</ul>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does your house have color?
<li>Does it use different shapes?
<li>Are there other parts of the scene beside just the house?
<li>Can you use a loop to add an interesting feature to your drawing?<li>Can you make something in the picture move?
</ul>

# TODO: In this module we'll make the nose reset when the up arrow is pressed.

# Additional challenges (time permitting):
#   Make the eyes move left and right with the left and right arrow button.
#   Make the nose color change when the spacebar is pressed.
#   Make the face grow and shrink with the g and s buttons.
#   Draw a proportionally incorrect stick figure body under the face using lines.
#   Make everything drawn move down off the screen if a the mouse down event occurs.

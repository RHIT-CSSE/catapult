1.  (Together) Firm up function idea by doing WindowPane.  Write the function
        WindowPane(x, y, width, height, bacgroundColor).  Then draw a couple
        of panes.  Then a horizontal row of panes. (perhaps varying the background Color
        using color_rgb)

2. Have students continue working on misc_graphics exercise.

3. While loops.  If I deposit P dollars in an account each month, and get i% interest each month,
                 how many months does it take for me to accumulate D dollars?
                 Run it for 100, 0.0025, 10,000.

4. If time, do click inside circle, connectTheDots (these will probably wait until this afternoon).
